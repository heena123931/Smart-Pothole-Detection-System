# Smart Pothole Detection and Clearance System for Pothole-Free Roads

Imagine a future where roads are free from potholes—a reality made possible with intelligent technology. This project aims to detect potholes in real-time and initiate automated clearance to ensure safe, smooth, and efficient road travel.

## Project Overview

This is our final year major project which combines IoT, sensors, and embedded systems to build a smart solution for pothole detection and repair. It helps reduce accidents, improve road safety, and support smart city infrastructure.

## Technologies & Components Used

- *Ultrasonic Sensors* – For pothole depth detection
- *ESP8266 / ESP32-CAM* – For wireless communication and live image streaming
- *Arduino IDE* – For programming and control logic
- *DC Motor, H-Bridge (L293D)* – For repair mechanism simulation
- *Battery* – For powering the system
- *Wi-Fi Module* – For real-time data transmission

## Features

- Real-time pothole detection
- Live video streaming using ESP32-CAM
- Automated repair mechanism simulation
- Data reporting and alerts
- Low-cost and scalable

## Advantages

- Reduces road accidents
- Cuts down maintenance costs
- Enhances driver comfort and road quality
- Supports smart city goals

## Limitations

- Prototype level (limited repair capability)
- Real-world scalability needs further enhancement
- Dependent on sensor accuracy and placement

## Future Scope

- Integration with smart city infrastructure
- AI-based pothole image classification
- Real-time data dashboard for authorities
- Solar-powered models for sustainability
